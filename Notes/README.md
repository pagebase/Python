> Why python language?

**Python is a beginner-friendly and highly versatile programming language, making it easy to learn and implement across various domains.** From web development and automation to data science and machine learning, Python is used virtually everywhere. Its clean syntax and vast ecosystem of libraries make it suitable for both simple tasks and complex projects.

In real-life applications, Python can help you:

- **Organize your digital files**: Automatically sort documents, photos, videos, and other files into appropriate folders based on type, name, or creation date.
    
- **Automate repetitive tasks**: Clean temporary files, rename batches of files, or schedule regular backups of important data.
    
- **Build intelligent tools**: Create your own AI agents or chatbots using frameworks like `LangChain`, `OpenAI API`, or `Rasa`.
    
- **Detect faces or objects**: Use OpenCV to build face detection systems or security monitoring apps.
    
- **Scrape data from websites**: Collect product data, reviews, or prices from sites like Amazon or Flipkart using libraries like `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, or `Selenium`.
    
- **Analyze and visualize data**: Use `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib` to process and visualize large datasets for insights and decision-making.
    
- **Create web apps**: Develop scalable web applications using frameworks like `Django` or `Flask`.
    
- **Develop games**: Use `Pygame` to build 2D games for learning and entertainment.
    
- **Build desktop applications**: Use `Tkinter`, `PyQt`, or `Kivy` to create user-friendly software interfaces.
    
- **Control IoT devices**: Integrate Python with Raspberry Pi to automate home appliances or build smart home solutions.
    
- **Automate browser actions**: Fill out forms, log into accounts, and perform web tasks with `Selenium` or `Playwright`.
    
- **Monitor stock prices or cryptocurrencies**: Pull real-time financial data and automate trading strategies.
    

For example, if your friend asks for a list of the best laptops under $5000, you can write a Python script to scrape laptop listings from Amazon or Flipkart, extract details like price, brand, and features, and save the results in an Excel file using the `openpyxl` or `pandas` library to share easily.

#### **Course FAQs:**

> **_Note: Many of these FAQs pertain to Notebooks, Anaconda, and Python. All of which we will discuss in Section 2 with video content. We have videos going over all about Python and the installation process. This FAQ is just here as a reference for you to visit whenever you wish. If you want to continue with the course and the install procedure, continue on to the next lecture. Thanks!_**

**1. Where can I find the Jupyter Notebooks for the Course?** The course is now in Python 3, but still have the older Python 2 notebooks available for reference in case you need them.

Python 3 Notebooks can be found here:

[https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp)  
  

The older Python 2 Notebooks can be found here:

[https://github.com/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp](https://github.com/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp)  

**2. How do I download the Notebooks? (We show this in a video in the next section)**

You can go to the GitHub page linked above and then click the _download zip_ button to download all the notebook (.ipynb) files onto your computer (compressed as a zip file, you'll need to unzip it). Check out the lecture "Getting the Notebooks" for a video guide to this.

**3. How do I know what directory my Notebooks are being saved?**

To find out where your notebooks are type: **pwd** in a cell and run it with Shift+Enter. This will print your working directory.

**4. How can I change where the Notebooks are being saved?**

You will need to change the directory in which you are starting you jupyter notebook. Use **cd** in the terminal or command prompt to change to your desired directory if you are running jupyter notebook at your command line. Alternatively, just navigate to your desired directory using the Anaconda Navigator as described in the lecture "Running Python Code".

**5. How do I open .ipynb files? What program do I choose? (We show this in a video in the next section)**

After installing Anaconda, search your computer for Anaconda Navigator, then launch jupyter notebook and move through the Jupyter Notebook interface until you reach your desired directory where you have your .ipynb files. Please note, you can not just double click a .ipynb file, it won't open that way.

Using Juptyer Notebook at your command line? Here are the instructions to open .ipynb files through your command line:

In order to open the Notebook Files you'll need to have Python and the Jupyter Notebook system installed, check out the Python Set-up section for more details on the installation of Python and the Jupyter Notebook system (or you can just follow the relevant instructions [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) if you feel more technical). Once you have python and the jupyter notebooks installed you are ready to open the notebooks using the following steps:  

1. First open up your Command Prompt (search for **cmd** on a Windows machine) or if you are on a Mac use your terminal (Spotlight search for **terminal**).
    
2. Next in you terminal/command prompt type **pwd** and press enter (this will print your working directory)
    
3. Take note of what file directory was displayed, this is where you should save your **.ipynb** files (or a folder containing your **.ipynb** files)
    
4. Once your **ipynb** files or folder containing the files is in the location displayed from the **pwd** step go back to your terminal and type **jupyter notebook** and press Enter.
    
5. After Step 4 you should have a browser tab open up with the Jupyter Notebook system running inside of it.
    
6. Click on your Notebook (or go to your folder of Notebooks) displayed in the Jupyter Notbeook and it will open in a new tab with the Notebook you selected.
    
7. You should now have successfully opened a Notebook file.
    

**6. How do I get my certification?**

Check out Udemy's official link on this (we don't control certification). 

[https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229603868-Certificate-of-Completion](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229603868-Certificate-of-Completion)

# Command line argument

**This allow you to programmatically move through your computer's directory. This include:**
1. Find your current directory
	> Type `cd` to know your current directory.
2. List all files in directory
	> Type `dir` to check every files, directory in your current directory.
3. How to change directory
	> Type `cd YourDirectoryName`. Example, if you been in `C:\India` and you wanna jump into `States` directory, you can do it by typing `cd States`. `cd` stands for **change directory**. If you are too lazy to type you can type `cd FirstLetterOFYourDirectory` and press `Tab` button on your keyboard, this will suggest you your letter matching directory.
4. How to clear command line screen
	> Type `cls` to clear your cluttered console.
5. How to get back one step back from directory?
	> Type `cd ..`, you can exit one directory.

**Step 1:** Visit [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
 >Why to use *Anaconda?*
 >Anaconda is a popular distribution of Python (and R) specifically designed for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. It simplifies package management and deployment, making it especially useful for handling large-scale data analysis and complex dependencies.

 >Key Features of Anaconda:

>1. Pre-installed Packages: Comes with 250+ popular Python packages (like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.) for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.


>2. Conda Package Manager: A powerful tool to install, update, and manage packages and environments, similar to pip but more suited for managing dependencies.


>3. Environment Management: Allows creation of isolated environments for different projects to avoid conflicts between package versions.


>4. Jupyter Notebooks: Includes Jupyter for interactive coding and data exploration.


>5. Spyder IDE: Often bundled with Anaconda as a scientific development environment for Python.



 >Why Use Anaconda?

>Beginner-friendly for data science and machine learning.

>Saves time by avoiding manual installation of complex libraries.

>Great for ensuring reproducibility with isolated environments.

**Step 2:** Download based on your operating system.
**Step 3:** Launch *Jupyter* notebook, this will get you in your default browser.
